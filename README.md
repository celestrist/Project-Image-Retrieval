Project-Image-Retrieval
=======================
This repository serves as a record for my study of image retrieval system, as a fullfillment for my Master degreein computer science.

I am using IPython notebook to organize my work. So all you have to do is:

1. clone this repository to your local machine

2. open a terminal

3. *cd* to the *Notebook* directory  

4. type *ipython notebook --pylab*

5. Either your default browser will open automatically; or you have to open it manually and type 127.0.0.1:8888 in the address bar.

6. open one of the notebook and have a look, you can always excecute the code yourself by pressing shift+enter
